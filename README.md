# Custom Element - Handle Events Base Class - Example

for the sake of typescript understanding this Repo provides a minimal example as
a discussion base for "how do I type such generic JS code properly".

In JS you can rely on certain assumptions, that seem impossible in Typescript.
Like "let the child class decide which events to handle" in this example.

Is there as possible way to express that freedom in Typescript?

## Run the example

```
deno run -A npm:vite
```
